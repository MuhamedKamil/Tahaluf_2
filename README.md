# Classification for clothing articles
------------

The Fashion-MNIST clothing classification problem is a new standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.

Dataset Link https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Although the dataset is relatively simple, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification from scratch, Which achieves impressive results.

Steps
------------
1- Download Dataset

2- Using Convoultion Neural Network for training the data

3- calculate Receptive field

4- calculate FLOPS and MAACs
